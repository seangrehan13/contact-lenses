    <p>A <strong>contact lens</strong> (also known simply as a <strong>contact</strong>) is a corrective, cosmetic, or therapeutic lens usually placed on the cornea of the eye. Leonardo da Vinci is credited with describing and sketching the first ideas for contact  lenses in 1508, but it was more than 300 years later before contact  lenses were actually fabricated and worn on the eye. Rigid ones were  produced and marketed first. Modern soft contact lenses were invented by  the Czech chemist Otto Wichterle and his assistant Drahoslav LÃ­m, who also invented the first gel used for their production.</p>
    <p>Some soft contact lenses are tinted a faint blue to make them more  visible when immersed in cleaning and storage solutions. Some cosmetic  lenses are deliberately colored to alter the appearance of the eye. Some  lenses now have a UV protection surface treatment to reduce UV damage  to the eye's natural lens.</p>
    <p>It has been estimated that 125 million people use contact lenses worldwide (2%),including 28 to 38 million in the United States and 13 million in Japan.The types of lenses used and prescribed vary markedly between  countries, with rigid lenses accounting for over 20% of  currently-prescribed lenses in Japan, the Netherlands and Germany but less than 5% in Scandinavia.</p><p>reference http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contact_lens</p>
